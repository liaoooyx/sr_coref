2. Put the `unlabeled_pool_5k` and `conll` folders into `/resources/active_learning/`

## Iteration Loop

1. Specify the current iter's num and the expected sampling num in `/src/config/active_learning.yaml`
2. main_part1_sampling.ipynb: model inference and unlabeled data sampling
3. Using BRATï¼šmanual annotation
4. main_part2_training.ipynb: labeled data resolution and building training data
5. Model training following `fast-coref`'s instrction
6. Repeat 1-4
